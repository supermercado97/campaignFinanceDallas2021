half of the top contributing addresses come from Park Cities Zip Codes

Looking closer than just zipcodes, we find that there are several addresses that not only donate in the highest bracket of campaign contributions, but also have several names associated.

Analysis shows that ther can be multiple donations under the same last name, but that are offered under different first names. This alone wouldn't be cause for alarm, but amidst these we find additional layers of obscurity among the highest campaign contributions.

Among PO Boxes, it's difficult to identify with any particular owner, but the amount donated sits well above the top 75% of contributions. Without the ability to identify which individual is associated with these contributions, we'll resort to analyzing the affiliated businesses.

As we have done with the majority of addresses, we're looking at the owners of these properties to identify the individuals responsible for funding these campaigns.

Further, since 10/20 of the top contributing addresses reside outside of Dallas City Council Districts, it's worth noting that the two candidates who received the highest amounts of out of state contributinons also received the greatest amount of out-of-district contributions

Chad West and Jaynie Schultz received $99,123 and $82,030 respectively. In other words, 34% of Chad West's campaign and 30% of Jaynie Schultz' campaign contributions came from out-of-district donors.

use quartiles to map how much in district vs out of district in each segment


new questions:
1. what percent of winning campaigns received donations from park cities
2. are the total contributions getting calculated correctly 
3. can we build a zipcode map by contributions
4. can we get a list of the following:
    - names of individuals/businesses making out-of-state donations (to who and how much)
    - names of individuals/businesses makign out-of-district donations (to who and how much)
    - names of individuals trying to hide their donations amounts
        - using aliases - same address, same last name
        - using the names of others in their household - same address, same last name
5. look into creating an alias dict to clean shit up.
